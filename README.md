# File-allocation-table
In this section, we will deploy a virtual filesystem. Most filesystems have multiple levels of directory structures, but for this command, we'll use only one level. These files are stored on a virtual drive in the Raspberry's memory. The storage location of files is managed in the File Allocation Table (FAT).
